# **String Multimatching**
#Example input:
#      2          <-- Number of search terms
#      p          <-- First search term
#      pup        <-- Second search term
#      popup      <-- Line to search in

#For each test case, output n lines, where the _i_’th line contains the positions of all the occurrences of the _i_’th pattern in text, from first to last, separated by a single space.

#Example output (0 based array):
#      2 4        <-- Index positions for the first search term "p", separated with space
#      2          <-- Index position for the second search term "pup"
#The problem is to find the index positions of the search terms in the input text and print a line for each search term.
